> Medaka is a Research Release.
>
> Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early
> access to features or stimulate Community development of tools. Support for
> this software will be minimal and is only provided directly by the developers.
> Feature requests, improvements, and discussions are welcome and can be
> implemented by forking and pull requests. However much as we would
> like to rectify every issue and piece of feedback users may have, the
> developers may have limited resource for support of this software. Research
> releases may be unstable and subject to rapid iteration by Oxford Nanopore
> Technologies.
>
> Please ensure that you are using the most recent version of medaka before filing
> a bug report. The most recent version can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka/releases).
> If you are not using the most recent release, and file a issue regardless the
> most likely response from our developers will be to ask you to first upgrade.
>
> Please ensure also to provide the information below, not doing so will likely
> result in a request for the information.
